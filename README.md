# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN

This project implements image classification on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**. The model is trained to classify 32x32 color images into one of 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.

### Key Features:
- Two convolutional layers for feature extraction with ReLU activation.
- MaxPooling layers for downsampling.
- Dense layers for classification, with a final softmax layer for outputting class probabilities.
- Model achieves competitive accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Technologies:
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **Python**
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations
